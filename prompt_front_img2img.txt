Use the input line-art image as the base. 
Keep the pose, body proportions, the exact hand mudra, and the arched title text “MASTER'S TOUCH MEDITATION” exactly as in the original image. 
Do not change the number of fingers, do not change the finger positions, do not add or remove limbs, do not distort the typography.

Add a soft colored background with a calm lake, distant mountains and gentle sunrise light. 
Add subtle shading and light gradients on the monk and clothes, but keep the line-art contours clean and readable. 
Overall style: high-quality digital illustration, tranquil meditation atmosphere.
