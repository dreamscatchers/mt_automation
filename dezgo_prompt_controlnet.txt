The character must have the same hand mudra as in the input image: index fingers touching to form a small triangle, other fingers curled the same way, thumbs hidden.

Background: simple white or very light, minimal details.
Negative prompt: photorealistic, 3d render, soft focus, noise, grain, fabric texture, blurry text.
