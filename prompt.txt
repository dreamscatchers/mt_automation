Line-art illustration of a monk sitting cross-legged, back straight, shoulders relaxed. Above his head an arched title: "MASTER'S TOUCH MEDITATION" – keep the exact arc shape and spelling. The hands form Maha Gyan Mudra at chest level: index fingers extended and touching to form a small upward-pointing triangle, middle, ring and pinky fingers curled inward, thumbs hidden, exactly four visible fingers on each hand. Preserve pose, proportions, mudra, finger count and typography, do not add extra limbs. Just re-render as a clean high-quality digital illustration with a tranquil meditation atmosphere and a harmonious background.
