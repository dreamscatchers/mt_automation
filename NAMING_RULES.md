# Naming Rules

## Google Apps Script (GAS) files

- Location: `gas/`
- File extension: use `.js` only (no `.gs`).
- File names: use `lower_snake_case` (no CamelCase).
- Match existing patterns for tests: `*_tests.js`.

These rules exist to keep naming consistent when generating new GAS files or tasks.
