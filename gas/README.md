# Google Apps Script (GAS)

This folder mirrors the Apps Script project.

Files here must be copied 1:1 into Apps Script.
Structure is logical (Apps Script has no real folders).

Do not rename functions without updating all references.

File extentions for this folder should be .js, not gs as they will be processed with clasp tool

Test functions that are run manually from the Apps Script IDE must not end with an underscore; the trailing underscore suffix is reserved for internal (private) helpers.
